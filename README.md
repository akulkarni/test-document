# Four score and seven years ago

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.


# My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)

My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;

Coral is far more red than her lips’ red;

If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;

If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.

I have seen roses damasked, red and white,

But no such roses see I in her cheeks;

And in some perfumes is there more delight

Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.

I love to hear her speak, yet well I know

That music hath a far more pleasing sound;

I grant I never saw a goddess go;

My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.

And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare

As any she belied with false compare.


# Harlem

What happens to a dream deferred?

Does it dry up

Like a raisin in the sun?

Or fester like a sore—

And then run?

Does it stink like rotten meat?

Or crust and sugar over—

Like a syrupy sweet?

Maybe it just sags

Like a heavy load.

Or does it explode?


# Constantly Risking Absurdity 

Constantly risking absurdity 
                                             and death 
            whenever he performs 
                                        above the heads 
                                                            of his audience 
   the poet like an acrobat 
                                 climbs on rime 
                                          to a high wire of his own making 
and balancing on eyebeams 
                                     above a sea of faces 
             paces his way 
                               to the other side of day 
    performing entrechats 
                               and sleight-of-foot tricks 
and other high theatrics 
                               and all without mistaking 
                     any thing 
                               for what it may not be 

       For he's the super realist 
                                     who must perforce perceive 
                   taut truth 
                                 before the taking of each stance or step 
in his supposed advance 
                                  toward that still higher perch 
where Beauty stands and waits 
                                     with gravity 
                                                to start her death-defying leap 

      And he 
             a little charleychaplin man 
                                           who may or may not catch 
               her fair eternal form 
                                     spreadeagled in the empty air 
                  of existence
